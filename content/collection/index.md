#### As I Began to Love Myself

“As I began to love myself I found that anguish and emotional suffering are only warning signs that I was living against my own truth. Today, I know, this is “AUTHENTICITY”. 

As I began to love myself I understood how much it can offend somebody if I try to force my desires on this person, even though I knew the time was not right and the person was not ready for it, and even though this person was me. Today I call it “RESPECT”. 

As I began to love myself I stopped craving for a different life, and I could see that everything that surrounded me was inviting me to grow. Today I call it “MATURITY”. 

As I began to love myself I understood that at any circumstance, I am in the right place at the right time, and everything happens at the exactly right moment. So I could be calm. Today I call it “SELF-CONFIDENCE”. 

As I began to love myself I quit stealing my own time, and I stopped designing huge projects for the future. Today, I only do what brings me joy and happiness, things I love to do and that make my heart cheer, and I do them in my own way and in my own rhythm. Today I call it “SIMPLICITY”. 

As I began to love myself I freed myself of anything that is no good for my health – food, people, things, situations, and everything that drew me down and away from myself. At first I called this attitude a healthy egoism. Today I know it is “LOVE OF ONESELF”.  

As I began to love myself I quit trying to always be right, and ever since I was wrong less of the time. Today I discovered that is “MODESTY”. 

As I began to love myself I refused to go on living in the past and worrying about the future. Now, I only live for the moment, where everything is happening. Today I live each day, day by day, and I call it “FULFILLMENT”. 

As I began to love myself I recognized that my mind can disturb me and it can make me sick. But as I connected it to my heart, my mind became a valuable ally. Today I call this connection “WISDOM OF THE HEART”.  

We no longer need to fear arguments, confrontations or any kind of problems with ourselves or others. Even stars collide, and out of their crashing new worlds are born. Today I know “THAT IS LIFE”!”

― Charlie Chaplin



#### 当我开始爱自己

当我开始爱自己，我发现痛苦和情感的折磨仅仅是提醒的信号，提醒我，自己正在背离着真实的自己而活。如今，我懂得了，这叫做，真实。

当我开始爱自己，我懂得如果我试着将我的意志强加于人，这将是何等的冒犯，即便在这时我知道，时机尚未成熟，而他，也尚未做好准备，即便这个人，就是我。今天，我把它叫做，尊重。

当我开始爱自己，我不再渴求一个不一样的人生，并且我能够明白，所有发生在我身边的事，都是对我成长的邀约。如今，我把它叫做，成熟。

当我开始爱自己，我明白无论在何时，我都处于正确的时间在正确的地点，所有一切发生的时机都恰到好处。如今，我称之为，自信。

当我开始爱自己，我不再浪费自己的时间，并停止对未来远大烙饼的设计。如今，我仅仅做能够为我带来愉悦和幸福的事情，我乐意去做，并能够使我的心为之鼓舞的事情，用我自己的方式，保持我自己的节奏。今天，我称之为，简单。

当我开始爱自己，我使自己远离所有有害健康的东西——食物，人，事情，场景，以及一切拖累我，背离真我的东西。起初，我把它叫做健康的利己主义。如今我懂得，这是 自爱。

当我开始爱自己，我停止尝试永不失败的行为，而自此我反而更少犯错了。如今，我称之为，谦逊。

当我开始爱自己，我拒绝活在过去或对未来满心焦虑。现在，我只活在当下，一切正在发生的地方。今天，我过好每一天，日复一日，而我称之为，富足。

当我开始爱自己，我意识到，我的思想可以扰乱我，并能使我失去活力。但当我将它与我的心灵相连， 我的思绪摇身一变，成为了我宝贵的盟友。今天我称这种连结为，心灵的智慧。

我们再也无需害怕争执，对抗，或者其他何种与我们自己或他人之间的问题。即便是行星碰撞，也会在他们的撞击过后，催生出一个全新的世界。今天我明白了，这就是生活！
